            The Object Space is a coordinate space in computer graphics and 
            represents an individual object's (e.g. a 3D object) frame of reference. 
            Its pivot or origin is the center of its own universe, only to later be put into relation to other objects with a common frame of reference in <a href="world_space.html"> World Space</a>.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            On a logical level, many modern video games are composed of units, often called objects (sometimes "Game Objects", "Scenes",...) that follow an <a href="object_oriented_programming">object-oriented approach</a>. They are defined as entities that embody specific functionalities (such as the player object, an interactable door, etc.)
            and modelled accordingly, adding attributes, properties, functions, and possible relations to other objects. It is worth noting that this approach is in itself digital: separating the modelled world into units that are managable and reduce complexity as to control contingency.

            The logical and visual component is often separated in game engines. There is a cut but interconnectedness between logical and visual components; ideally, the core mechanics of the game function without elaborate visual representations. Technically, the clothes of NPCs in a computer game could be replaced by a 3D model of a <a href="utah_teapot.html">teapot</a>. While game logic is usually developed within the tools, visual elements are created in various other software (such as Blender, Maya, Substance Painter, Photoshop, Aseprite, and more).
